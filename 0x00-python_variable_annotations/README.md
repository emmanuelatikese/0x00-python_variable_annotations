Python Annotations
Overview
Python annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3 that allow you to add metadata, such as types, to function parameters and return values. Annotations are optional and do not affect the runtime behavior of the code, but they can provide valuable information for developers and tools like type checkers and linters.
Syntax
Annotations are added using colons and arrow notation (->). They can be applied to function parameters, return values, and variables.
