### this is all about python annotations.
##Python Annotations
#Overview
Python annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3 that allow you to add metadata, such as types, to function parameters and return values. Annotations are optional and do not affect the runtime behavior of the code, but they can provide valuable information for developers and tools like type checkers and linters.
Syntax
Annotations are added using colons and arrow notation (->). They can be applied to function parameters, return values, and variables

#Usage
Type Hinting: Annotations can be used to specify the expected types of function parameters and return values.
Documentation: Annotations can serve as documentation for developers, providing clarity on the expected inputs and outputs of functions.
Type Checking: Annotations can be utilized by static type checkers like MyPy to perform type checking and catch type-related errors early in development.
IDE Support: Annotations enhance IDE support by enabling better code completion and type inference.
Guidelines
Use annotations to improve code readability and maintainability.
Be consistent in annotating function parameters and return values.
Remember that annotations are optional and do not affect the runtime behavior of the code.
