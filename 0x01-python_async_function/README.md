### this is work is all about asyncio in python.
Overview
asyncio is a Python library used for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It provides an event loop, coroutines, and tasks which allow for asynchronous programming. asyncio is suitable for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Key Concepts
Event Loop
The event loop is the core of every asyncio application. It runs in a single thread and repeatedly checks for events, processes them, and then waits for new events. The event loop drives the execution of asynchronous tasks.

## Coroutines
Coroutines are special functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for asynchronous execution. They are defined using the async def syntax and are awaited using the await keyword.
