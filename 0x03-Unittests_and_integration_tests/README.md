### this is project is all about various kind of testing using python
## 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests
## Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.

In Python, the unittest module provides a framework for creating and running unit tests. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of tests from the reporting framework. Hereâ€™s a small example of a unit test in Python:

python
Copy code
import unittest

# The function to be tested
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Creating a test case
class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_integers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)

    def test_add_floats(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1.1, 2.2), 3.3)

    def test_add_strings(self):
        self.assertEqual(add('Hello', ' World'), 'Hello World')

# Running the tests
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
This example defines a simple add function and a TestAddFunction class with three test methods to check if the add function works correctly with integers, floats, and strings. Running unittest.main() will execute these tests and report the results.
